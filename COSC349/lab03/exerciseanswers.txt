Q. Examine the Vagrantfile to see if you can deteremine where the differences
are from the default Vagrantfile created by the vagrant init command, and 
the purpose of these changes.
    A. The file uses port forwarding, perhaps in preparation for a local
    virtualisation environment (as only the host is able to access the
    virtual machine).
    There is also a provisioning script for installing Apache2. This may be
    a prerequisite installation for the virtualisation environment.

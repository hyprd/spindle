Our script takes input of a list of words, and then outputs a reasonable estimate for the number of syllables in each word. 
Also included in our submission is a text file we used to test our script. 
Our solution does struggle with sequential vowels which are not diphthongs or triphthongs.
We found this website very useful when writing our conditions for counting vowels: howmanysyllables.com/howtocountsyllables

We run it by pipelining from command line: python3 syllableSlam.py < test-cases.txt

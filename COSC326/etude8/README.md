# Internet Animation 

##### This animation was made using Unity 2018.4.10f1 (LTS). Please build using this version.

##### Standalone builds for Windows, Linux and macOS are working although the animation is designed for building to WebGL. 

##### WebGL shouldn't allow running of builds on local browsers (unless machine security is unimportant to you). I suggest hosting it on a website/webserver or altering security settings of your browser to permit browsers to run local files.
